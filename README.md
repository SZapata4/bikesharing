# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City and present it to some investors looking to start a bikeshare business in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Results

The first thing we are going to look at is the demographic of users form the New York City data below. Although the demographics in New York and Des Moines might not be the same you can at least get an idea of what type of users you will have.

Looking below we are continuing to analyze the bike sharing data by gender. In the graph we can see the number of bikes rented by gender and trip duration. From this we can see that males use the most bikes and that most of bike rentals are within the 0 to 1 hour trip duration.

In the graph below it reinforces the idea that most of the rides are shorter that 1 hour and more specially that most rides take under 20 minutes. Longer trips on the bikes seem to be very rare.

In the trips by Weekday graph below we see that the busiest time for rides Monday to Friday is somewhere from 6 to 9 in the morning and 5 to 7 in the afternoon. On the weekend we can see bike usage is spread evenly from 9am to 7pm.

In the graph below it emphasizes the same busy time zones as stated in the trips by Weekday graph and furthers the idea of more male usage than female.

In the top starting spots graph below it shows us where all bike trips start from. This graph gives us an idea of where most of the ride originate from which from this graph it looks like the city areas create more rides than the suburbs.

Lastly, the graph below shows us which days of the week each gender takes trips. In this graph it once again solidifies that most of the user base is male.

## Summary

After looking at these graphs one can see that bikeshareing services work well in high density metropolitan areas, where using a car may be impracticable. The other obvious thing we can see from this data is that the user base is made up of mostly males. I would find ways to market to females to raise the number of users and increase profits.

If I wanted to look further into this data to find trends, I might look at creating some more visuals like the below:

  •	Trip number or trip duration by age so you can see what age groups are already using the service and which ones to target with marketing campaigns.
  
  •	Trips by month so that you can see the trends in usage throughout the year.
